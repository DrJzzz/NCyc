# NCyc database for fast and accurate metagenomic profiling of N cycle genes 
Nitrogen (N) cycle is one of the most important biogeochemical cycles in the Earth ecosystem and has gained extensive foci in ecology and environmental studies. During the past decades, extensive efforts have been applied to characterize N cycle pathways in various ecosystems using different approaches. Until recently, shotgun metagenome sequencing have been applied to explore N cycle related gene families and link them with environmental processes. However, there are problems in applying publically available orthology databases to profile N cycle gene families in shotgun metagenomes, such as inefficient database searching, unspecific orthology groups, and low coverage of N cycle genes and/or gene (sub)families in large-scale orthology databases. A curated high quality reference database is therefore in urgent need for metagenomic analysis of N cycle gene families. To solve these issues, we built a manually curated integrative database (NCyc) for fast and accurate profiling of N cycle gene (sub)families from shotgun metagenome sequencing data.
